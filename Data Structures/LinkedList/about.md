# The Linked List
Alternative to using an array.  Instead of contigious in memory, each node has a pointer to the next node.

## Uses
* When expanding an array is too expensive!  Can continually add only 1 node at a time
* Can be used instead of an array in the Queue or Stack ADT
* Much easier to insert and remove that arrays, while arrays are better at access

## Complexity
* Access: O(n)
* Search: O(n)
* Insert: O(1)
* Delete: O(1)
* Space:  O(n)
